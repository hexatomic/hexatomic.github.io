# About this project documentation

Our project is funded as part of the call 
["Research Software Sustainability"](http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/funding_opportunities/call_proposal_software/)
by [Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)](http://www.dfg.de/en/).

The call description read

> The objective of this call for proposals is the building and testing of 
infrastructures in order to make research software available and provide it in 
a sustainable manner to a larger audience. As best-practice examples, projects 
should have a positive impact on research-software development and on 
infrastructure facilities.

To fulfill this requirement, we will establish a minimal infrastructure
for the sustainable development and provision of research software, cf. also
the original 
[project proposal](./static/pdf/hexatomic_project_description_website.pdf).

Not only will the resulting software, **Hexatomic**, have to be sustainable, 
the infrastructure that is used to develop and provide it will need to as well.

One of the explicit aims of the call is to provide "best practice examples" for
future projects. In order to make the extraction of best practices from our
project possible, it is necessary to document not only the actual software and
infrastructure, but also the *processes through which decisions have been
arrived at* in the course of the project. This concerns all levels of decisions,
including software engineering decisions, infrastructural components, 
architectural decisions, workflow decisions, tooling decisions, etc.

The right place to document processes and decisions is the documentation of the
project itself which is provided here.

The project documentation is a "living document", i.e., it is constantly added
to and changed, and may change in its structure. It does not refer to a specific 
version of **Hexatomic**, and is not versioned like the user, developer and 
maintainer documentation for the software. Instead, it is a place where the
practices of our project are iteratively developed as a base for discussion and
extraction of good practices in sustainable research software development.
