# Documentation

This section describes how we approach and implement documentation.

Documentation is a core aspect of our project. We argue that in order to
sustain a research software project, it must be documented on different levels,
including for users, developers, and maintainers. Additionally, we document
decisions we make during the project runtime, in order to enable traceability
of decisions, and potentially the extraction of best practices for the
sustainable development and provision of research software.

Documentation within the context of the project takes four different forms, or
rather, addresses four different target groups:

- *Users* of the **Hexatomic** software  
- *Developers* of/contributors to the **Hexatomic** software  
- *Maintainers* of the **Hexatomic** software, and of the infrastructure that is
developed and implemented to develop and provide it  
- The *research software community* as the large set of people, projects, 
funders and other stakeholders, etc., which is interested in research software 
engineering, research software development, the sustainability of research 
software, research software infrastructure, etc.
