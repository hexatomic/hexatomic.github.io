# Documentation

This section describes how we approach and implement documentation.

Documentation within the context of the project takes four different forms, or
rather, addresses four different target groups:

- *Users* of the **Hexatomic** software  
- *Developers* of/contributors to the **Hexatomic** software  
- *Maintainers* of the **Hexatomic** software, and the infrastructure that is
developed and implemented to develop and provide it  
- The *research software community* as the large set of people, projects, 
funders and other stakeholders, etc., which is interested in research software 
engineering, research software development, the sustainability of research 
software, research software infrastructure, etc.
