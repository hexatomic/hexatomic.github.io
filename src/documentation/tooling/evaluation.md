### Documentation tooling &mdash; evaluation and implementation

There are several factors influencing the sustainability of documentation in
research software projects:

1. Sustainability of the source texts
2. Ease of facilitation
3. Sustainability of the documentation tooling
4. ...

In order to ... a single tool for all of the project's documentation (user,
developer, maintainer documentation; project documentation).

#### Sustainability

As of now, reliable measures for predicting the sustainability of a software do 
not exist [1], and intrinsically, the actual sustainability of a software can
only be determined in hindsight. Therefore, assessing the sustainability
potential for a software is a qualitative process, partly driven by the
requirements of the project for which the software is assessed.
