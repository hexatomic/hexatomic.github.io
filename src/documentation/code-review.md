# Code Review

Code review is an essential part of our project.
We are using the tools of the GitHub platform for performing code reviews in the public and don't distinguish between
“internal” contributions from core team members and “external” ones.
Having a platform like GitHub allows to discuss code changes, make these discussions transparent to others and also serve as an additional history
of *how* and *why* the code become part of Hexatomic.
Having such a central place for discussions is especially important for teams where the team members might be splitted between several institutions and can't meet regulary in the same room.
While we are currently using GitHub code reviews, the same principles and standards for code review could be applied for other platforms/tools like [Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/) or [git-appraise](https://github.com/google/git-appraise).
