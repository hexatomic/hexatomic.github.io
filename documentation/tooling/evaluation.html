<p>Although we have attempted to make our evaluation as objective as possible,
subjective biases and preferences will usually influence choice of tooling

<h3 id="sustainability"><a class="header" href="#sustainability">Sustainability</a></h3>
<p>As of now, reliable measures for predicting the sustainability of a software do 
not exist [1], and intrinsically, the actual sustainability of a software can
only be determined in hindsight. Therefore, assessing the sustainability
potential for a software is a qualitative process, partly driven by the
requirements of the project for which the software is assessed.</p>
<p>Despite this constraint, assumptions over the sustainability potential of a
documentation software project can be based on some assessable factors, e.g., 
age of the software, approximated user base, development status, frequency of 
contributions, architecture, pervasiveness of a technological community,
level of documentation, maturity of its dependencies, etc.</p>
<p>In the evaluation process, we have tried to approximate each candidate's
potential for sustainability, which we present in the following.
Additionally, we give the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190927154132/https://docs.libraries.io/overview.html#sourcerank">SourceRank metric for high quality packages</a> used by libraries.io, based on the actual products we would employ.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a> is a documentation generator written in
Python. It is used to generate the <a href="https://docs.python.org/">documentation for the Python programming
language</a> itself as well as many large 
<a href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/examples.html">Python projects</a>. The
documentation platform <a href="https://readthedocs.org/">Read the Docs</a> uses Sphinx to
automate the creation and deployment of software documentation.</p>
<p>We have rated the sustainability of Sphinx with rST as very high (5).<br />
We have rated the sustainability of Sphinx with CM as medium (3) due to additionally required extensions and the non-standard use case which is not as well supported as the standard one using rST.<br />
SourceRank metric for the Sphinx project: <a href="https://libraries.io/pypi/Sphinx/sourcerank">23</a></p>
<p>Python, Sphinx' implementation language, is a highly used programming language, with an estimated <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages"><strong>41% market share</strong></a>,
as of 2019, and <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=%2Fm%2F05z1_#TIMESERIES"><strong>increasing interest</strong></a> as of June 2019.
Sphinx has a <strong>high criticality</strong> due to its use as the Python language documentation platform,
and its <strong>pervasiveness</strong> of the Python community, where it must be regarded as the default documentation tool.
As of June 2019, Sphinx is <a href="https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/network/dependents"><strong>used by over 57,000 projects</strong></a> on Github alone.
The Sphinx hosting service Read the Docs has hosted around <a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2018-stats/">100,000 projects</a> in 2018 (including Sphinx and mkDocs projects).
Sphinx is a mature project, with <strong><a href="https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/releases">126 releases</a></strong>, the first one from <a href="https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/releases/tag/v0.1.61611">Mar 2008</a>.
It is also actively developed, with an average of around <strong>3 commits per day</strong>, with the last <strong>100 commits within the last 17 days</strong> at the time of writing, 
a <strong>contributor base of <a href="https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/graphs/contributors">422</a></strong>, of which <strong>51 (12%) have actively contributed over the last year</strong>, and in this period, <strong>45 contributors (11%) have made more than 1 commit</strong>.
Sphinx has averages of <strong>0.9 issues per day</strong> and <strong>0.5 pull requests per day</strong>.
Its <strong>5 dependencies</strong> seem to be mature, based on the fact that they all have been released in major versions.</p>
<h4 id="mdbook-i-classfa-fa-starii-classfa-fa-starii-classfa-fa-starii-classfa-fa-starii-classfa-fa-star-oi"><a class="header" href="#mdbook-i-classfa-fa-starii-classfa-fa-starii-classfa-fa-starii-classfa-fa-starii-classfa-fa-star-oi">mdBook <i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star-o"></i></a></h4>
<p><a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/">mdBook</a> is a documentation generator written in
Rust. It is used to generate the main documentation (both the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference/">reference documentation</a>, and &quot;<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Book</a>&quot;) for the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust programming
language</a> itself.</p>
<p>We have rated the sustainability of mdBook as high (4).<br />
SourceRank metric: <a href="https://libraries.io/cargo/mdbook/sourcerank">15</a></p>
<p>Although Rust, mdBook's implementation language, is relatively young - <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160609195720/https://www.rust-lang.org/faq.html#project">development has started in 2006</a> -
it is growing <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">in popularity</a> and sees <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0dsbpg6#TIMESERIES">increasing interest</a>.
Major software projects are written in Rust, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_(Mozilla)">Quantum and Servo browser engines</a>, developed by Mozilla and used in the Firefox web browser,
Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency, Dropbox's file system, and security features in the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> project. 
mdBook has a <strong>high criticality</strong> as the main documentation tool for the Rust language itself and its pervasiveness as the documentation tool for many Rust projects.
mdBook is a relatively mature project, with <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook/releases"><strong>44 releases</strong></a>, the first one from <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook/releases/tag/v0.0.1">Aug 2015</a>.
It is also actively developed, with an average of around <strong>0.86 commits per day</strong>, with the last <strong>100 commits within the last 96 days</strong> at the time of writing, 
a <strong>contributor base of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook/graphs/contributors">124</a></strong>, of which <strong>43 (35%) have contributed over the last year</strong>, and in this period, <strong>22 contributors (18%) have made more than 1 commit</strong>.

<h3 id="usability"><a class="header" href="#usability">Usability</a></h3>
<p>Assessing the usability of software is an opinionated process which takes into account encountered and predicted use in a specific context.
In our evaluation, we have taken into account the readability of the source format, Javadoc integration, continuous integration capabilities,
maintainability, maintainability of dependencies, and the usability of representations.</p>
<h4 id="human-readable-source-format"><a class="header" href="#human-readable-source-format">Human-readable source format</a></h4>
<p><em>Sphinx (rST)</em> <i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star-o"></i><i class="fa fa-star-o"></i><br />
We have evaluated reStructuredText to be less-than-perfectly human-readable and human-usable due to </p>
<ul>
<li>its syntax for hyperlinks, which is not in-situ but instead uses an in-text underscore syntax <code>Text `link text_` text</code> in combination
with a text-external external footnote syntax <code>.. _link text: https://hyperlink</code> for named links, which compares unfavourably with the Markdown
format;</li>
<li>the four-whitespace indentation convention for code blocks, which disallows easy copy and paste of valid source code snippets.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sphinx (CM), mkDocs, mdBook, Jekyll</em> <i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><br />
We have evaluated Markdown to be very human-readable and human-usable, independent of implementation dialects. Markdown
does not exhibit the same syntax-specific issues as reStructuredText.</p>
<p><em>Asciidoctor</em> <i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star-o"></i><br />
We have evaluated AsciiDoc, the input format for Asciidoctor, to be human-readable, despite some idiosyncrasies in the syntax, such as
<code>&lt;whitespace&gt;+</code> for single line breaks, and the less graphic headline syntax.</p>
<h4 id="javadoc-integration"><a class="header" href="#javadoc-integration">Javadoc integration</a></h4>
<p>We have eventually decided to disregard the integration of Javadoc API documentation as a deciding factor for the best-suited documentation
tool for the project. Javadoc-based HTML generation has been a standard feature of Java and Maven for years, and linking from any 
running text documentation to the respective API documentation is trivial, and can be automated in continuous integration. 
Nevertheless we provide a quick overview of the evaluations here.</p>
<p>At the time of the evaluation, only Sphinx with reStructuredText offered a clear way to integrate Javadoc, 
via the <a href="https://github.com/bronto/javasphinx">javasphinx</a> extension.
This extension has since been deprecated, and therefore, the requirement is of no consequence for the
evaluation anymore.
This is why all tools have been evaluated as not providing Javadoc integration with a score of <code>1</code>.</p>
<h4 id="continuous-integration-capabilities"><a class="header" href="#continuous-integration-capabilities">Continuous integration capabilities</a></h4>
<p>All evaluated tools can be automated via a continuous integration solution such as Travis CI (used in our project).
However, bespoke scripts have to be created (and maintained) to produce and deploy the respective HTML representations,
as none of the tools provide this functionality out-of-the-box.
Therefore, all tools have been evaluated with medium capabilities (<code>3</code>), with the exception of Asciidoctor, for which a
Maven plugin exists, which you can read about on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190927065918/https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-maven-plugin/">Asciidoctor website</a>. As Hexatomic uses Maven in the build process, this is helpful, and Asciidoctor has therefore been
evaluated with a score of <code>4</code>.</p>
<h4 id="maintainability"><a class="header" href="#maintainability">Maintainability</a></h4>
<p>We have looked at the maintainability of the tools, and have mainly evaluated ease-of-installation and updates, and dependencies.</p>
<p>Sphinx with rST and mkDocs are installable and updatable via standard Python technologies, i.e., an installation of Python and <code>pip</code>.
mdBook is provided as a binary, which can be downloaded and used as is; alternatively, the standard way to install Rust software also works, i.e., via a Rust and <code>cargo</code>
installation. All three tools are more or less self-contained to run required functionality such as tables of contents, search, etc., out-of-the-box, with existing modules for further
functionality, and have therefore been scored with <code>4</code>.</p>
<p>Asciidoctor requires an implementation of Ruby, and can be installed from an OS package manager or as a Ruby gem. It also requires extensions for
processing documentation sources, which has led to a lower evaluation at <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, Sphinx with CM has bee evaluated at <code>2</code>, as it requires hacks to include directives in Markdown which are not natively supported, such
as the ones needed to create a table of concents. These leads to manual work which in turn needs to be standardized within the project, documented, and followed.
This leads to a loss of maintainability for Sphinx with CM.</p>
<h4 id="mainainability-of-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#mainainability-of-dependencies">Mainainability of dependencies</a></h4>
<p>Dependencies in our evaluation are additional software which has to be installed in order to use the respective tool in our project.
mdBook has fared best, as it did not need additional software that needed to be actively installed, although a large number of its runtime dependencies do not have
major releases.
Jekyll has achieved the lowest score, as specific functionality required the inclusion of many plugins in the configuration file.
The other tools have received scores of <code>3</code>, as they needed a modicum of configuration via extensions and/or had a larger number of runtime dependencies with non-major releases.</p>
<h4 id="usability-of-representations"><a class="header" href="#usability-of-representations">Usability of representations</a></h4>
<p>mkDocs and Jekyll have both received low scores in assessing the usability of their HTML outputs.
mkDocs can handle multiple pages, and contains global search, but it generally does not provide
many features. This includes a maximum navigation depth of 2, which is not sufficient for our use case.
Jekyll does not provide search or tables of contents out-of-the-box, and has to be customized to achieve
the required level of functionality.
Asciidoctor provides no client-side search, and per default produces single pages only.
Sphinx does provide access to different versions of the documentation, and provides
multi-page functionality and tables of contents, but its search does not provide good results.
mdBook provides good search, different themes per default, menu fold functionality, multiple pages and a table of contents, as well
as forward and backward buttons, code copy, and single page prints which can also be used to generate PDFs.</p>
<h3 id="different-representations"><a class="header" href="#different-representations">Different representations</a></h3>
<p>Only Sphinx can comfortably handle a large number of different representations of documentations,
such as LaTeX, EPub3, man pages, and more. The common PDF format has to be produced using an extension.
mdBook uses a generic approach by providing a print button which compiles a single page view of the documentation.
This can then be used to produce PDFs or other outputs via the browser's print dialogue.
Asciidoctor has an external PDF converter, which, however, requires Ruby. It can produce manpages natively.
Producing different presentations from Jekyll is cumbersome. PDFs can be produced via HTML to PDF conversion software, and a wrapper plugin for Jekyll exists.
mkDocs does not support PDF conversion natively, although a plugin exists, which, however, relies on different other software which have to be installed separately.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>To calculate a final score for each tool, we have calculated the mean for all usability sub-categories in (3), and
have calculated the mean across the three values. The results are presented in the table below, and
are also available as a <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sdruskat/hexatomic.github.io/blob/src/src/static/ipynb/Hexatomic%20Project%20-%20Documentation%20Tooling%20Evaluation.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a>.</p>

<p>Due to the restrictions in usability (and slightly decreased human-readability) that reStructuredText represents (cf. section <a href="#human-readable-source-format">Human-readable source format</a>),
as well as a personal preference for markdown, we have decided to use <strong>mdBook</strong> for the text-based documentation of Hexatomic.</p>
<h4 id="implementation"><a class="header" href="#implementation">Implementation</a></h4>
<p>We use local installations of mdBook on development machines to write the user, the developer &amp; maintainer, and this project documentation.
We use the Travis CI continuous integration platform to produce the documentation representations, and deploy them
to GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>The sources for the project website reside in a dedicated repository, <a href="https://github.com/hexatomic/hexatomic.github.io">github.com/hexatomic/hexatomic.github.io</a>.
The sources for the Hexatomic software are held in the development repository for Hexatomic, <a href="https://github.com/hexatomic/hexatomic">github.com/hexatomic/hexatomic</a>.</p>
