<p><em>&quot;A minimal infrastructure for the sustainable provision of extensible multi-layer 
annotation software for linguistic corpora&quot; (Hexatomic)</em> was a joint research project
at Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena and Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.
It was funded under the call <a href="http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/funding_opportunities/call_proposal_software/">&quot;Research Software Sustainability&quot;</a>
issued by <a href="http://www.dfg.de/en/">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</a> under grant
number 391160252 and ran from October 2018 until September 2021. </p>
<p>The project aimed to implement, test, and document <em>a minimal infrastructure for
the sustainable development, provision, and maintenance of research software</em>.
The <a href="./static/pdf/hexatomic_project_description_website.pdf">complete project proposal is available as a PDF</a>.</p>
<p>This infrastructure will be used to provide the linguistic community with
<em>software for deep multi-layer annotation of linguistic corpora</em>.</p>
<p>The project is located at the

<p>Our project is funded as part of the call 
<a href="http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/funding_opportunities/call_proposal_software/">&quot;Research Software Sustainability&quot;</a>
by <a href="http://www.dfg.de/en/">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</a>.</p>
<p>The call description read</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The objective of this call for proposals is the building and testing of 
infrastructures in order to make research software available and provide it in 
a sustainable manner to a larger audience. As best-practice examples, projects 
should have a positive impact on research-software development and on 
infrastructure facilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To fulfill this requirement, we will establish a minimal infrastructure
for the sustainable development and provision of research software, cf. also
the original 
<a href="./static/pdf/hexatomic_project_description_website.pdf">project proposal</a>.</p>
<p>Not only will the resulting software, <strong>Hexatomic</strong>, have to be sustainable, 
the infrastructure that is used to develop and provide it will need to as well.</p>
<p>One of the explicit aims of the call is to provide &quot;best practice examples&quot; for
future projects. In order to make the extraction of best practices from our
project possible, it is necessary to document not only the actual software and
infrastructure, but also the <em>processes through which decisions have been
arrived at</em> in the course of the project. This concerns all levels of decisions,
including software engineering decisions, infrastructural components, 
architectural decisions, workflow decisions, tooling decisions, etc.</p>
<p>The right place to document processes and decisions is the documentation of the
project itself which is provided here. Among other things, the project 
documentation will therefore serve as a decision log.</p>
<p>The project documentation is a &quot;living document&quot;, i.e., it is constantly added
to and changed, and may change in its structure. It does not refer to a specific 
version of <strong>Hexatomic</strong>, and is not versioned like the user, developer and 
maintainer documentation for the software. Instead, it is a place where the
practices of our project are iteratively developed as a base for discussion and
extraction of good practices in sustainable research software development.</p>
<h1 id="implementing-documentation"><a class="header" href="#implementing-documentation">Implementing documentation</a></h1>
<p>This section describes how we approach and implement documentation.</p>
<p>Documentation is a core aspect of our project. We argue that in order to
sustain a research software project, it must be documented on different levels,
including for users, developers, and maintainers. Additionally, we document
decisions we make during the project runtime, in order to enable traceability
of decisions, and potentially the extraction of best practices for the
sustainable development and provision of research software.</p>
<p>Documentation within the context of the project takes four different forms, or
rather, addresses four different target groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Users</em> of the <strong>Hexatomic</strong> software</li>
<li><em>Developers</em> of/contributors to the <strong>Hexatomic</strong> software</li>
<li><em>Maintainers</em> of the <strong>Hexatomic</strong> software, and of the infrastructure that is
developed and implemented to develop and provide it</li>
<li>The <em>research software community</em> as the large set of people, projects, 
funders and other stakeholders, etc., which is interested in research software 
engineering, research software development, the sustainability of research 
software, research software infrastructure, etc. </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="documentation-sustainability"><a class="header" href="#documentation-sustainability">Documentation sustainability</a></h1>
<p>The sustainability of software documentation is directly related to the
sustainability of the software it pertains to. Without documentation that is 
<em>correct</em> and <em>complete</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> at all times, a software cannot be expected to be
usable at any point in the future. </p>
<p>&quot;At all times&quot; here describes the <em>synchronic</em> aspect of documentation 
sustainability. In practice, this is related to engineering, development and
maintenance practices of a qualitative nature, as all involved parties must take
care to keep documentation up-to-date, while only parts of this process may be
easily automatable or measurable. Some methods for documenting source code in 
situ, e.g., 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a>, aid
efforts to achieve synchronic sustainability, but they are not applicable in all
projects, and usually additional documentation, e.g., for end users, must be
created. Contribution and maintenance workflows can support the fulfillment of
the completeness and correctness requirements by implementing methods such as
code review, static code analysis, etc.</p>
<p>There is also a <em>diachronic</em> aspect to documentation sustainability, which is of
a more technical nature, and is equivalent to technical sustainability of 
software. It pertains to the sustainability of the documentation <em>tooling</em>, and
to the sustainability of the documentation artifacts, i.e., the documentation
&quot;products&quot;, such as rendered files (PDF, HTML, etc.) and sources, but also to
compatibility with rendering systems (e.g., browsers), and the availability and 
findability of sources and artifacts.</p>
<p>In the context of software projects, this yields the following concrete
requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Synchronic sustainability must be ensured by applying software engineering
methods to the documentation workflow. This includes code and 
documentation review, leveraging IDE support for in situ documentation of source 
code, implementation of code styles such as naming conventions, <a href="https://githubengineering.com/runnable-documentation/">runnable 
documentation</a>, etc.</li>
<li>Diachronic sustainability must be ensured by choosing sustainable tooling,
and implementing documentation sources and artifacts so that they remain
findable, available, and accessible.</li>
</ol>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>It is important to note that <em>complete</em> may mean different things in
different situations. Private/internal functions, e.g., private methods in Java,
may not have to be documented, while public/external functions that may use them
must be.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="documentation-tooling"><a class="header" href="#documentation-tooling">Documentation tooling</a></h1>
<p>This section provides details on <em>how</em> documentation for the research project,
and the <strong>Hexatomic</strong> software as well as the infrastructure used to develop and
provide it, is facilitated.</p>
<h2 id="requirements"><a class="header" href="#requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>The requirements for documentation tooling are specific to our research project
in some respects (e.g., pertaining to Javadoc), but all others can be applied
to generic (research) software project setups. And those that are 
project-specific can probably be transferred to other use cases relatively 
easily.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Requirements summary</strong></p>
<p>The requirements for documentation tools for sustainable software development are</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Sustainability</li>
<li>(2) Single tool toolchain</li>
<li>(3) Usability
<ul>
<li>(3a) Human-readable source format</li>
<li>(3b) Javadoc integration</li>
<li>(3c) Continuous integration capabilities</li>
<li>(3d) Maintainability</li>
<li>(3e) Maintainability (dependencies)</li>
<li>(3f) Usability of representations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(4) Different representation forms</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="sustainability"><a class="header" href="#sustainability">Sustainability</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="documentation/tooling/../sustainability/">documentation sustainability</a> section establishes that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[documentation] sustainability must be ensured by choosing sustainable tooling 
[...].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Software sustainability covers many aspects, including community parameters such
as size, number and frequency of contributions; whether a code is open source;
the programming language it is implemented with; ease of installation; its
dependency tree, etc.</p>
<p>Accordingly, there is currently no canonic definition of software 
sustainability, as discussed in [1]. One of the definitions given in [1] seems
operationable enough to use in the context of documentation tooling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sustainable software is software which is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to evolve and maintain</li>
<li>Fulfils its intent over time</li>
<li>Survives uncertainty</li>
<li>Supports relevant concerns (Political, Economic, Social, Technical,
Legal, Environmental)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="single-tool-toolchain"><a class="header" href="#single-tool-toolchain">Single tool &quot;toolchain&quot;</a></h3>
<p>One of the key motivations behind the choice of tooling is to have <em>one single 
software</em> which we use for all of our (textual) documentation. This makes

<h4 id="human-readable-sources"><a class="header" href="#human-readable-sources">Human-readable sources</a></h4>
<p>In the event of a failure in the documentation <em>software</em>, the documentation
<em>sources</em> must be readable and well-structured enough to function as a fallback
in place of, e.g., HTML- or PDF-rendered documentation.</p>
<p>We use a combination of hierarchical directory structures and human-readable
source file formats to achieve this.</p>
<h4 id="javadoc-integration"><a class="header" href="#javadoc-integration">Javadoc integration</a></h4>
<p>As <strong>Hexatomic</strong> is written in Java, we use 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc">Javadoc</a> to document source code 
in situ. This way, we can generate 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a> 
documentation in HTML directly from the source code via the 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/solaris/javadoc.html">javadoc</a> 
tool. This specific API documentation format is used standardly across most
Java software projects<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#ossrh-requirements">1</a></sup> and is something that code contributors will expect to
find.</p>
<p>In order to boost findability of the API documentation, it would be helpful
to be able to integrate the Javadoc HTML in the text documentation for 
developers as easily as possible, ideally through native support for this by the
documentation software.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="ossrh-requirements"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>For example, all release artifacts of open source 
projects that are hosted on &quot;Maven Central&quot;, the main repository for the 
dominant build system for Java (cf. [2]), are uploaded through the <a href="https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html">Open Source
Software Repository Hosting 
(OSSRH)</a> system, which 
requires artifacts to include a bundled version of the Javadoc API documentation.</p>

<h4 id="continuous-integration-capabilities"><a class="header" href="#continuous-integration-capabilities">Continuous integration capabilities</a></h4>
<p>In order to embed documentation deeply in the project as well as the development 
workflow, editing documentation must be as easy as possible and should ideally
not require more than making the actual change in the documentation without 
having to care about building the representation, deployment, etc.</p>
<p>The default way to achieve this for any kind of code, including documentation
sources, is to employ a continuous integration (CI) system which polls the 
version control system where the code is held for changes, and reacts to these 
changes by starting the appropriate action, e.g., by building the code and 
deploying the artifacts.</p>
<p>The documentation software should therefore enable continuous integration of its
builds and automated deployment of the documentation representations, either 
natively, or via the continuous integration system used in the project, or by 
simply not preventing the application of a CI system, to trigger builds and
deploy artifacts through, e.g., a custom script run on the CI system.</p>
<p>In addition to providing an easy way to produce documentation, automated 
deployment will also ensure that the user-facing representation of the
documentation can be up-to-date at all times.</p>
<h4 id="maintainability"><a class="header" href="#maintainability">Maintainability</a></h4>
<p>The documentation software should be very easily maintainable.</p>
<p>This includes factors like easy updates to new versions of the software; 
no installation required or very simple to install; no or very few dependencies
on other software, or ready-made packages that include all dependencies.</p>
<h4 id="usability-of-representations"><a class="header" href="#usability-of-representations">Usability of representations</a></h4>
<p>The documentation representations produced by the documentation software should
have a high level of usability. </p>
<p>While some of the features that make 
documentation &quot;usable&quot; for a reader may depend on a specific reader's
approach to documentation as well as her own preferences, some factors of
usability are more easily quantifiable, e.g., a representation's ability to
display well on different devices - which is usually a feature of responsive or 
reactive design paradigms. Further factors include the existence and behaviour
of a table of contents or menu, font choices, colour schemes, intuitivity of
interfaces, simplicity, and a consistent style that users can &quot;learn&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="different-representation-forms"><a class="header" href="#different-representation-forms">Different representation forms</a></h3>
<p>The documentation software should ideally be able to produce representations
in different formats, e.g., produce a HTML representation of the documentation,
a PDF file, an EPUB file, etc.</p>
<p>Different representations are required to serve the purposes of different
parts of the documentation. While API documentation may be read mainly
during development work and should therefore be provided as hyperlinked
documents in a website for quick accessibility and browsing, user documentation
may be read in larger portions at a time, e.g., during preparation or evaluation
phases, and should therefore <em>also</em> be available as a portable and potentially
printable format such as PDF or EPUB.</p>
<h2 id="available-tools"><a class="header" href="#available-tools">Available tools</a></h2>
<p>To find a tool that fulfills as many of the requirements as well as possible,
and that is suitable for our project context, we have surveyed different 
documentation software.</p>
<p>These tools would be
feasible to use as the single tool for text-based documentation (as compared to
Javadoc) in our project (requirement (2)). At the same time, we only considered
tools that use a human-readable source format as input to create documentation
representations (requirement (3a)). This included only tools that use an
easily human-readable text-based markup language, i.e., a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> dialect,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText">reStructuredText</a>, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc">AsciiDoc</a>.</p>
<p>It also excluded other commonly used tools, e.g., 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandoc">Pandoc</a>, if they are not mainly
targeted at creating software documentation. Pandoc, for example,
does not support out-of-the-box conversion to HTML beyond single pages.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have excluded tools which seemed too little known, i.e., which
failed the &quot;list test&quot;, the hypothesis being that if a tool would not be 
included in a sample of list websites (&quot;Top 10 software documentation tools&quot;, 
&quot;15+ Software Documentation Tools That Will Simplify Your Life&quot;, etc.) it would
not have enough market share, which may imply a small user base and therefore
not enough community incentive to keep it alive over the next few years.</p>
<p>Out of the whole section of generic static site generators (of which most 
documentation tools are a subset of), we have chosen Jekyll because it is
natively supported by <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, our chosen
documentation hosting solution. The reasons why we use GitHub Pages are
explained in another section (forthcoming). <!-- FIXME Replace with link to actual section--></p>
<p>We ended up with the following shortlist of tool options.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">Sphinx</a> (Python) with reStructuredText (rST) input</li>

<li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> (Ruby) with <a href="https://kramdown.gettalong.org/">Kramdown</a> or other Markdown input</li>

<h3 id="sustainability-1"><a class="header" href="#sustainability-1">Sustainability</a></h3>
<p>As of now, reliable measures for predicting the sustainability of a software do 
not exist [1], and intrinsically, the actual sustainability of a software can
only be determined in hindsight. Therefore, assessing the sustainability
potential for a software is a qualitative process, partly driven by the
requirements of the project for which the software is assessed.</p>
<p>Despite this constraint, assumptions over the sustainability potential of a
documentation software project can be based on some assessable factors, e.g., 
age of the software, approximated user base, development status, frequency of 
contributions, architecture, pervasiveness of a technological community,
level of documentation, maturity of its dependencies, etc.</p>
<p>In the evaluation process, we have tried to approximate each candidate's
potential for sustainability, which we present in the following.
Additionally, we give the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190927154132/https://docs.libraries.io/overview.html#sourcerank">SourceRank metric for high quality packages</a> used by libraries.io, based on the actual products we would employ.</p>

<li>its syntax for hyperlinks, which is not in-situ but instead uses an in-text underscore syntax <code>Text `link text_` text</code> in combination
with a text-external external footnote syntax <code>.. _link text: https://hyperlink</code> for named links, which compares unfavourably with the Markdown
format;</li>
<li>the four-whitespace indentation convention for code blocks, which disallows easy copy and paste of valid source code snippets.</li>
</ul>

We have evaluated Markdown to be very human-readable and human-usable, independent of implementation dialects. Markdown
does not exhibit the same syntax-specific issues as reStructuredText.</p>
<p><em>Asciidoctor</em> <i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star-o"></i><br />
We have evaluated AsciiDoc, the input format for Asciidoctor, to be human-readable, despite some idiosyncrasies in the syntax, such as
<code>&lt;whitespace&gt;+</code> for single line breaks, and the less graphic headline syntax.</p>
<h4 id="javadoc-integration-1"><a class="header" href="#javadoc-integration-1">Javadoc integration</a></h4>
<p>We have eventually decided to disregard the integration of Javadoc API documentation as a deciding factor for the best-suited documentation
tool for the project. Javadoc-based HTML generation has been a standard feature of Java and Maven for years, and linking from any 
running text documentation to the respective API documentation is trivial, and can be automated in continuous integration. 
Nevertheless we provide a quick overview of the evaluations here.</p>
<p>At the time of the evaluation, only Sphinx with reStructuredText offered a clear way to integrate Javadoc, 
via the <a href="https://github.com/bronto/javasphinx">javasphinx</a> extension.
This extension has since been deprecated, and therefore, the requirement is of no consequence for the
evaluation anymore.
This is why all tools have been evaluated as not providing Javadoc integration with a score of <code>1</code>.</p>
<h4 id="continuous-integration-capabilities-1"><a class="header" href="#continuous-integration-capabilities-1">Continuous integration capabilities</a></h4>
<p>All evaluated tools can be automated via a continuous integration solution such as Travis CI (used in our project).
However, bespoke scripts have to be created (and maintained) to produce and deploy the respective HTML representations,
as none of the tools provide this functionality out-of-the-box.
Therefore, all tools have been evaluated with medium capabilities (<code>3</code>), with the exception of Asciidoctor, for which a
Maven plugin exists, which you can read about on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190927065918/https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-maven-plugin/">Asciidoctor website</a>. As Hexatomic uses Maven in the build process, this is helpful, and Asciidoctor has therefore been
evaluated with a score of <code>4</code>.</p>
<h4 id="maintainability-1"><a class="header" href="#maintainability-1">Maintainability</a></h4>
<p>We have looked at the maintainability of the tools, and have mainly evaluated ease-of-installation and updates, and dependencies.</p>
<p>Sphinx with rST and mkDocs are installable and updatable via standard Python technologies, i.e., an installation of Python and <code>pip</code>.
mdBook is provided as a binary, which can be downloaded and used as is; alternatively, the standard way to install Rust software also works, i.e., via a Rust and <code>cargo</code>
installation. All three tools are more or less self-contained to run required functionality such as tables of contents, search, etc., out-of-the-box, with existing modules for further
functionality, and have therefore been scored with <code>4</code>.</p>
<p>Asciidoctor requires an implementation of Ruby, and can be installed from an OS package manager or as a Ruby gem. It also requires extensions for
processing documentation sources, which has led to a lower evaluation at <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, Sphinx with CM has bee evaluated at <code>2</code>, as it requires hacks to include directives in Markdown which are not natively supported, such
as the ones needed to create a table of concents. These leads to manual work which in turn needs to be standardized within the project, documented, and followed.
This leads to a loss of maintainability for Sphinx with CM.</p>
<h4 id="mainainability-of-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#mainainability-of-dependencies">Mainainability of dependencies</a></h4>
<p>Dependencies in our evaluation are additional software which has to be installed in order to use the respective tool in our project.
mdBook has fared best, as it did not need additional software that needed to be actively installed, although a large number of its runtime dependencies do not have
major releases.
Jekyll has achieved the lowest score, as specific functionality required the inclusion of many plugins in the configuration file.
The other tools have received scores of <code>3</code>, as they needed a modicum of configuration via extensions and/or had a larger number of runtime dependencies with non-major releases.</p>
<h4 id="usability-of-representations-1"><a class="header" href="#usability-of-representations-1">Usability of representations</a></h4>
<p>mkDocs and Jekyll have both received low scores in assessing the usability of their HTML outputs.
mkDocs can handle multiple pages, and contains global search, but it generally does not provide
many features. This includes a maximum navigation depth of 2, which is not sufficient for our use case.
Jekyll does not provide search or tables of contents out-of-the-box, and has to be customized to achieve
the required level of functionality.
Asciidoctor provides no client-side search, and per default produces single pages only.
Sphinx does provide access to different versions of the documentation, and provides
multi-page functionality and tables of contents, but its search does not provide good results.
mdBook provides good search, different themes per default, menu fold functionality, multiple pages and a table of contents, as well
as forward and backward buttons, code copy, and single page prints which can also be used to generate PDFs.</p>
<h3 id="different-representations"><a class="header" href="#different-representations">Different representations</a></h3>
<p>Only Sphinx can comfortably handle a large number of different representations of documentations,
such as LaTeX, EPub3, man pages, and more. The common PDF format has to be produced using an extension.
mdBook uses a generic approach by providing a print button which compiles a single page view of the documentation.
This can then be used to produce PDFs or other outputs via the browser's print dialogue.
Asciidoctor has an external PDF converter, which, however, requires Ruby. It can produce manpages natively.
Producing different presentations from Jekyll is cumbersome. PDFs can be produced via HTML to PDF conversion software, and a wrapper plugin for Jekyll exists.
mkDocs does not support PDF conversion natively, although a plugin exists, which, however, relies on different other software which have to be installed separately.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>To calculate a final score for each tool, we have calculated the mean for all usability sub-categories in (3), and
have calculated the mean across the three values. The results are presented in the table below, and
are also available as a <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sdruskat/hexatomic.github.io/blob/src/src/static/ipynb/Hexatomic%20Project%20-%20Documentation%20Tooling%20Evaluation.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a>.</p>

<p>Due to the restrictions in usability (and slightly decreased human-readability) that reStructuredText represents (cf. section <a href="documentation/tooling/evaluation.html#human-readable-source-format">Human-readable source format</a>),
as well as a personal preference for markdown, we have decided to use <strong>mdBook</strong> for the text-based documentation of Hexatomic.</p>
<h4 id="implementation"><a class="header" href="#implementation">Implementation</a></h4>
<p>We use local installations of mdBook on development machines to write the user, the developer &amp; maintainer, and this project documentation.
We use the Travis CI continuous integration platform to produce the documentation representations, and deploy them
to GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>The sources for the project website reside in a dedicated repository, <a href="https://github.com/hexatomic/hexatomic.github.io">github.com/hexatomic/hexatomic.github.io</a>.
The sources for the Hexatomic software are held in the development repository for Hexatomic, <a href="https://github.com/hexatomic/hexatomic">github.com/hexatomic/hexatomic</a>.</p>

<h1 id="code-review"><a class="header" href="#code-review">Code Review</a></h1>
<p>Code review is an essential part of our project: Code and documentation changes come in as pull requests, and all pull requests will undergo review.
We are using the tools of the GitHub platform for performing code reviews in public and do not distinguish between
&quot;internal&quot; contributions from core team members and &quot;external&quot; ones.
Having a platform like GitHub allows us to discuss changes, make these discussions transparent to others, and also use the public discussions as an additional history
of <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> the code has become part of Hexatomic.
Having a central place for discussions is especially important for distributed teams, where team members might be split over several institutions and cannot meet regularly in the same room.
GitHub was chosen as the general platform for hosting the code, issues, and documentation, and GitHub code reviews are an integral part of the platform.
While we are currently using GitHub code reviews for convenience, the same principles and standards for code review could be applied for other platforms/tools like <a href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/">Gerrit</a> or <a href="https://github.com/google/git-appraise">git-appraise</a>.</p>
<h2 id="objectives"><a class="header" href="#objectives">Objectives</a></h2>
<p>Developer and maintainer resources are scarce and every code review is an additional overhead to the actual implementation.
An objective is, therefore, to <em>keep the effort for code review proportional</em> to the development effort.</p>
<p>Code reviews can request changes and it is important that this feedback loop is <em>not obstructing the development process</em>.
It must be ensured that there is both enough time for the developer to address the requested changes and that these changes are reviewed quickly.
Also, the longer a pull request is not processed, the more conflicts to other developments can occur, which may lead to features not being deployed in a timely manner.</p>
<h2 id="responsibilities"><a class="header" href="#responsibilities">Responsibilities</a></h2>
<p>It must be clear who is responsible for performing code reviews, and these responsibilities have to be documented in the maintainer documentation.
In research projects like Hexatomic, we propose that this should be the general responsibility of the maintainer(s).
They can delegate the code reviews to others if appropriate or necessary.
E.g., if the maintainer is submitting a pull request themself, another person should be responsible for code review.
Delegating code reviews can help distribute the workload over several people.</p>
<p>In Hexatomic we have three areas where contributions require code review.</p>
<h3 id="project-documentation"><a class="header" href="#project-documentation">Project documentation</a></h3>
<p>One of the purposes of the project documentation is to report progress and outcomes of our research, similar to a formal project report. In fact, it is our approach to generate the project report based on the project documentation.
We therefore argue that ideally, the documentation should be reviewed by the principal investigators (PIs).
To avoid a &quot;chicken and egg&quot; problem, project maintainers who are also the researchers in the project can review each other's pull requests to bootstrap the initial documentation, e.g., about how code review is performed.</p>
<p>Once the project is completed, the project documentation will probably not need any updates.
If an update is still necessary, the maintainers can decide who should review it.</p>
<h3 id="user-developer-and-maintainer-documentation"><a class="header" href="#user-developer-and-maintainer-documentation">User, developer and maintainer documentation</a></h3>
<p>The maintainer should suggest a suitable person for a review of changes to documentation.
This can include other project members and PIs who are not developers, but also external users.
We argue that especially user documentation can benefit from a user perspective in the review process.
This means that informed users must be enabled to make updates in and add changes to the documentation, and to use the review user interface. In order to achieve this, the code review process and involved technology is documented in the maintainer documentation, to share with reviewers.</p>
<h3 id="software-code"><a class="header" href="#software-code">Software code</a></h3>
<p>For changes to the actual Hexatomic software, a maintainer is responsible for code review. They may also enlist additional reviews from others.</p>
<h2 id="review-schedules"><a class="header" href="#review-schedules">Review schedules</a></h2>
<p>To find the right balance between a quick code review feedback loop, and justifiable overhead for maintainers, we propose
to have weekly dedicated time slots where the maintainers perform the code review.
How much time is allocated, and when exactly these time slots are, depends on the work schedule of the actual maintainer.
The time slots should be documented in the <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file to make them transparent to external contributors.
An example would be to have two time slots of one hour each per maintainer, on two different days in the week, with one day in between the review slots.
This would allow the contributor to update the pull request with the requested changes and still get a new review in the same week.
Ideally, a pull request with minor remarks could be merged in the same week it is created.</p>
<p>We think it is important to limit the amount of time per week a maintainer has to invest in code reviews.
This allows the calculation of man-hours required to maintain a software project, and to plan funding of  maintenance work.
If too many code reviews are requested at the same time, we propose to triage them first and give them a visible priority.</p>
<h1 id="periodic-unreviewed-code-triage"><a class="header" href="#periodic-unreviewed-code-triage">Periodic unreviewed code triage</a></h1>
<p>The maintainer has a very central position in our proposal for a minimal sustainable research software infrastructure.
While a maintainer is responsible for integrating external contributions, and for releasing new versions of the software, we did not envision this position as someone who actively extends the software with new features.
Having a maintainer for a project makes sure that there is always a point of contact for other developers who want to contribute to the project. This can help to keep the project alive, and ensures that certain software engineering standards such as code review can be followed.</p>
<h2 id="issues-with-the-maintainer-role"><a class="header" href="#issues-with-the-maintainer-role">Issues with the maintainer role</a></h2>
<p>Keeping a project alive can mean different things depending on the software and the expectation of the community.
We tried to minimize the work that needs to be done by the maintainer and moved responsibility to the community that uses the software to help keep it alive, e.g. by providing funding for a limited time to add a specific feature or fix a bug which is of a particular interest for this user.</p>
<p>However, there are issues that threaten the fundamental availability of the software itself, if not fixed.
For example, if the execution environment changes in a backward incompatible way, sometimes only small adjustments to startup scripts or build configuration can fix these issues.
Or if there is a security issue in one of the dependencies that can easily be fixed by just updating to a fully backward compatible patched version.
If a software can't be run on current systems, but only on out-of-date virtual machines or containers with potentially vulnerable operating systems, the actual usability and “aliveness” of a software is under serious threat.
Some issues can be mitigated to a certain degree by carefully choosing the software your project depends on, but some issues just cannot be predicted.
Thus, maintaining a software may also mean fixing these kinds of issues, and therefore the maintainer may actually have to change code.</p>
<p>This leads to a dilemma: if the maintainer themself is changing the code, who is reviewing it for correctness?</p>
<h2 id="pool-of-reviewers"><a class="header" href="#pool-of-reviewers">Pool of reviewers</a></h2>
<p>One possible solution to this problem is to have larger developer community with at least two maintainers.
For projects with a small user base, this may not be achievable even if the software is essential for their research.
In research areas like the humanities, funding for developers is typically limited to an active project phase and there is often only funding for a single developer.
We initially thought that student assistants may be able to fill the gap as second maintainers and reviewers, but hiring a student assistant may not be possible for all projects.</p>
<p>An alternative solution is to have Research Software Engineering (<em>RSE</em>) teams at an institution, who can contribute as code reviewer-on-demand.
These RSE groups are essentially professionalized and paid communities of maintainers for a whole institution.
Unfortunately, very few organizations do have such RSE teams as pool for reviewers yet.
It is also not an easy task to develop the permanent funding at each institution that is needed for the establishment of an RSE group, and as such RSE groups do therefore not provide a short term solution.
If a pool of code reviewers could be provided on a larger scale and on a volunteer basis, for example as some kind of &quot;Stack Overflow for open source research software code reviewers&quot;, this could enhance the situation for smaller projects.
Still, some way of scheduling this resource is needed, and it is not clear who should do the organization and funding of the platform itself.</p>
<h2 id="postponing-the-review-with-unreviewed-code-triages"><a class="header" href="#postponing-the-review-with-unreviewed-code-triages">Postponing the review with unreviewed code triages</a></h2>
<p>This idea is based on the current funding situation for smaller projects, especially in the humanities, where the presence of only a single maintainer can be guaranteed for the originally funded lifetime of a software project at most, and where there is no institutional pool of reviewers.
It is inspired by the &quot;weekly performance triage&quot; of the Rust compiler,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#rust-triage">1</a></sup> where performance regressions for new code in the compiler are not measured and detected for each pull request, but are triaged every week, and the offending pull request is only identified if a regression has been found in any of the changes since the week before.</p>
<p>For critical bug fixes that hinder the execution of the software (but not for new features or non-urgent bug fixes), the single maintainer can author the fix and add a regular pull request, but decide not to request a code review.
In this case, all required and all optional checks of the continuous integration pipeline must execute successfully.
This includes successful test execution, but specifically also static code analysis, where the goal should be to not introduce any new issue and to stay in the acceptable limits of metrics such as test coverage for new code, or maximum line duplication.
Having an advanced static code analysis in the continuous integration pipeline is a strict requirement for this approach.
Once all checks have passed, the maintainer marks the pull request with a special label for unreviewed pull requests and merges it, thus producing a new hotfix release of the software.</p>
<p>To ensure that all fixes are still reviewed at some point in the future, the project should introduce periodic reviews of previously unreviewed changes.
For Hexatomic, we use a quarterly approach.
During triage, a reviewer will look into a special triage log file in the repository to determine which source revision was triaged last.
Next, all pull requests with the &quot;unreviewed&quot; label are merged into a new version control branch which is based on the last triaged commit.
The changes are reviewed and if there are any issues found, they are added to the issue tracker of the project, so that they can be resolved later.
A triage report is added to the log file, and the &quot;unreviewed&quot; label is removed from all triaged pull requests, so that the next reviewer can start from the latest commit at this point of time.
The process itself is documented in our developer/maintainer documentation, so anyone can perform the triage.</p>
<p>An advantage of this approach is that these code audits can bundle several pull requests, and if there is short-term funding for another developer or the possibility to contract an external company or freelancer to perform these audits, someone who did not write the code is reviewing it.
But even if no external developer is available, and instead the original maintainer performs the reviews after some time, we expect that the maintainer is able to find issues in the code which where overlooked the first time when the code was still actively present in their mind.</p>
